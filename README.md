# Coursera:  Analytics-Capstone-Project -- University of Colorado, Boulder

The analytics process is a collection of interrelated activities that lead to better decisions and to a higher business performance. The capstone of this specialization is designed with the goal of allowing one to experience this process. The capstone project will take you from data to analysis and models, and ultimately to presentation of insights. 

In this capstone project, we will analyze the data on financial loans to help with the investment decisions of an investment company. We will go through all typical steps of a data analytics project, including data understanding and cleanup, data analysis, and presentation of analytical results. 

First goal is to understand the data and prepare the data for analysis.  Data preprocessing and cleanup is often the first step in data analytics projects. This step is crucial for the success of the project.  

Next we will perform some predictive analytics tasks, including classifying loans and predicting losses from defaulted loans. we will try a variety of tools and techniques, as the predictive accuracy of different tools can vary quite a bit. It is important to tune the different models in order to improve the performance.

Next we turn our attention to prescriptive analytics, where we will provide some concrete suggestions on how to allocate investment funds using analytics tools, including clustering and simulation based optimization. We will see that allocating funds wisely is crucial for the financial return of the investment portfolio.

Finally we will present the analytics results to the clients. A Power Point file is attached to this repository.
